# Prerequisites

## Platforms

- Tier 1: my(author's) primary development environment
    - Windows 10
- Tier 2: will got bugs fixed and tested on ci
    - Linux (WSL2)
- Tier 3: will not be tested, may not work
    - MacOS
    - Windows 7

!!! info
    I do not have MacOS, so I cannot debug issues on MacOS. That is why it is in Tier 3.

    If you would like better support for MacOS, please consider becoming a maintainer.

## Python

We support all Python versions that are currently in their lifecycle. The current version is `>= 3.9`.

<https://www.python.org/downloads/>

!!! warning
    For linux development, [you need to ensure that your Python installation contains a shared library](https://pyo3.rs/v0.23.3/index.html#using-python-from-rust).

    To install the Python shared library on Ubuntu: `#!bash sudo apt install python3-dev`.

    To install the Python shared library on RPM based distributions (e.g. Fedora, Red Hat, SuSE), install the `python3-devel` package.

## Rust

The latest stable version.
